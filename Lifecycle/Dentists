# WE ARE THE DENTISTS
  
Requirements:
	Based on the information received after meeting with a  client, put together everything that needs to be done (not how it should be done
    Client meeting
    SRS Document is a postcondition
    Client needs vs wants
    The precondition is the problem/goal
    The postcondition is to move to the design
    Ask questions about the given instructions
    Defining what needs to be accomplished
                                                                                                                 
Design:
	How everything that needs to be done should be done, based on the requirements
    High-level design
    Architectural design
    Detailed design
    Technology to meet requirements
    Precondition: SRS doc
    Blueprint of how requirements will be implemented
    The solution to the requirements/plan for implementation
                                                                                                                 
Implementation:
	Design brought to life by creating a product
    Code for the project (maybe)
    Precondition: some sort of design/design docs
    Meet requirements during implementations
    Postcondition: Test the solution made during the implementation
    Bringing the design to life/acting on design requirements
    Solution to design
                                                                                                                 
Test:
	Test to ensure the software does what it's supposed to do AND handles what it isnâ€™t intended to do
                                                                                                                 
Release:
	You release the tested implementation to the general public. Make it readily available
                                                                                                                 
Support/Maintenance:
	Upkeep software with minor fixes to issues
                                                                                                                 
Upgrades/Updates:
  The addition of new features and/or components based on client/customer feedback and changes in technology
