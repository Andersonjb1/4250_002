- I have created and managed repos in multiple other classes.
- I am comfortable with version control.
- I am very detail oriented so anything to do with documents I can do.
- Open to any position.

### *However*
- I wouldn't say I'm the most comfortable with JS. I can probably figure it out, but I have never used it.
