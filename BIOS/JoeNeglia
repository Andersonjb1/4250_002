I work well in leadership positions through an organized lead-by-example approach. 
I've gained experience with this through sports and a Head Lifeguard position.

I am most comfortable with the following programming languages:
  - java
  - C#
  - Python
  - HTML

I have had some experience with the following programming languages:
  - C  
  - JavaScript

I have little experience with front end development, so I am much more comfortable with 
backend. While a project manager or backend developer position would be ideal, I am flexible 
and a quick learner. So I am happy to play any role that is best for the team.
